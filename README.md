This was my first 3D project with three.js (that I was pround of :)

It about a demo FPS shooter game to learn and test things with three.js.

The game rules:
You shoot every pegmen 20 times before it became ghost. You have 20 bullets in your weapon. Every time you miss a target and hit a building you spend a bullet. If you hit in empty space or hit a target (pegman) you do not spend a bullet. When you hit a target (pegman) you earn a bullet bonus. When you spend the 20 bullets of your gun you must reload (with C key). Then 20 bullets from your ammo are loaded in your gun. Every time you reload a new fresh pegman added in population. 
There is also a machine gun (key X) where you can increase population fast (and spend you ammo quickly ;)
The game is endless. Scope is to get the maximum population (that your GPU afford) with the maximum positive amount of ammo.

Enjoy!
