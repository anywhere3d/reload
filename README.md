This was my first 3D project with three.js (that I was pround of :)

Its about a dummy FPS shooter game I made to learn and test things with three.js.

The game rules: You fly and shoot using mouse buttons. Left Mouse Button (LMB) shoots and move you forward. Right Mouse Button (RMB) shoots and move you backward. Turn your view left or right according the mouse cursor in your screen.
You shoot every pegman 20 times before it became blue ghost. You have 20 bullets in your weapon. Every time you miss a target and hit a building you spend a bullet. If you hit in empty space or hit a target (pegman) you do not spend a bullet. When you hit a target (pegman) you earn a bullet bonus. When you spend the 20 bullets of your gun you must reload (with C key). Then 20 bullets from your ammo are loaded in your gun. Every time you reload a new fresh pegman added in population. 
There is also a machine gun (key X) where you can increase population fast (and spend you ammo quickly ;)
The game is endless. Scope is to get the maximum population (that your GPU afford) with the maximum positive amount of ammo.

Enjoy!
